# card-game-demo

This is a personal project for learning. I am trying to improve on my previous demo. The demo includes a finite state machine implemented for each card. 

## Releases
To get the executable for this demo, downloaded the latest release.

## Learning goals
I am trying to follow good code practices and techniques including the following:

- Composition - Try to make smaller components, that are reusable and decoupled from other components.
- State machines - Implement finite state machines wherever convinient.
- Static and non-static data - Make static objects that hold static data and functions for reusability.
- Signaling - Make child objects signal up to parent objects, to reduce coupling.
